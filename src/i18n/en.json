Larger planets or those closer to their stars cause more noticeable wobbles.

We began with TESS data and a simple catalog. Then I wanted to learn Three.js, so I gave this old project a complete makeover, adding 3D procedural planets, custom shaders, habitability scoring, and much more. Welcome aboard!",
